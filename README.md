# Overview

As a computer information technologies student building my programming skills, I created this "Hello World" program as a first step with my development setup and to start my personal software portfolio. This is my first project where I'm focusing on a simple code and good documentation.

This is a easy Python program that prints "Hello World" to the screen. I added a little personal touch with a message about my coding journey to make it more fun.

I started this to practice setting up my tools, get familiar with GitHub, and create a location for future projects. It's my first step in keeping track of my progress, while explaing what I did and why.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my code editor — Git handles my files so I can track changes and share the code publicly.

I went with Python because it's straightforward to read and write, especially for beginners. No complicated setup needed — after a quick download, I could jump right in to write and run the code immediately.
